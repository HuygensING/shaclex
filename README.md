## Introduction

This is an experimental implementation of SHACL and ShEx. Both are implemented using the same underlying mechanism which is based
 on a purely functional approach.

## Installation and compilation

The projects uses [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).  

## Usage

It is possible to run sample programs by just:

```
sbt "run -d examples/good1.ttl"
```
